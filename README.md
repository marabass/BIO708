# BIO708

The first script, DataCleanUp.R takes as input the csv file containing data from the species starvation experiment. The code examines the structure and classes of the data frame, generates a plot that compares the number of observations for each species, and removes one species (D_orena) with a low number of observations (n = 13) relative to other species in the data set. The script also generates subsets the data into tables showing all observations seperately for each of the traits. Finally, the script generates a RDS file containing the 'cleaned' data set. The script is located in my main QMEE directory and should be run from the main QMEE directory. 

The second script, WingsizeConditionPlot.R takes as input the RDS file containing the 'cleaned' species starvation data. The code generates a boxplot with jittered points showing the distribution of the  mean wing area in micrometers for each species at both condition levels. The script is in my main QMEE directory and should be run from the main QMEE directory. 

One of the major questions I plan on addressing using this data set is whether we see a similar pattern of condition-dependent sexual dimorphism in traits exhibiting male- vs female-biased dimorphism. Some of the steps I can take to carry out this investigation: 
- Generate tables for each species, showing condition (HC and LC), sex, and size measurements for each specimen. This could also be used to compute total counts for condition and sex, and species-, sex-, and condition-specific means for size data for each trait. I can use information on size averages for each sex to determine the direction of the size dimorphism for each trait in the species. These tables should be assigned to variables and saved. 
- I can then compare the relationship between condition and size dimorphism for male- and female-biasede traits across the species in the phylogeny.
