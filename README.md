Thurs Jan 11, 2024: The data set I have chosen for the class (MP_SpeciesStarvation_Clean.csv) contains measurements taken for thorax and tarsus length, tibia length and width, and wing area from  27 species of Drosophila, belonging to the melanogaster species group. The flies underwent no (assumed) starvation during development - representing the high condition (HC) cohort - and the longest viable period of starvation (varied depending on the species and its development time) - representing the low condition (LC) cohort. 

A major goal of this experiment was to determine whether the expression of sexual size dimorphism (SSD) is condition dependent (CD). That is, do we see a correlation between the extent of SSD and the degree of condition dependence exhibited for the measured traits. I am specifically interested in determining if sexual size dimorphism in the legs segments is condition dependent. If we observe a relationship between SSD and CD, is it observed in all species in the phylogeny? Is the relationship the same for species that exhibit male-biased vs female-biased SSD? I am interested in comparing the observed relationship between SSD and CD in D. prolongata, which exhibits male-biased SSD for all traits to those observed in species like D. melanogaster, which exhibits female-biased size dimorphism.
